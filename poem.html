        content: `The other day, I saw her from the bus window,<br>
        just walking closer, about to step in.<br>
        I smiled without thinking<br>
        and then, it happened.<br><br>
        Her eyes met mine,<br>
        just for a second,<br>
        then she looked down,<br>
        trying to hide the curve of her lips.<br>
        But she looked again…<br>
        and this time, she smiled.<br><br>
        God, that smile<br>
        it struck me like lightning,<br>
        and at the same time,<br>
        it healed every part of me I never knew was broken.<br>
        Her smile kills me<br>
        not in pain, but in the sweetest way,<br>
        as if my heart can’t hold<br>
        so much beauty all at once.<br><br>
        To me, her smile is pure,<br>
        untouched by anything cruel,<br>
        as if it was made only<br>
        to light the darkest corners of my soul.<br>
        It blooms inside me like spring,<br>
        soft, endless, full of color.<br><br>
        If happiness had a face,<br>
        it would be hers when she smiles.<br>
        And if love had a beginning,<br>
        it started for me<br>
        the moment her lips curved that way—<br>
        gentle, radiant, unforgettable.<br><br>
        Her one smile is enough<br>
        enough to make me the happiest boy alive,<br>
        enough to turn an ordinary day<br>
        into the most beautiful memory<br>
        I’ll carry forever.`

        content: `He stands at the edge, with a heart full of fire,<br>
        A boy with a dream, his heart’s only desire.<br>
        She says, “Don’t fall for me, I won’t be your song,<br>
        I’m not the one you seek; my love’s not where you belong.”<br><br>
        But like the sun, that circles the earth with care,<br>
        He can’t stop revolving, drawn to her anywhere.<br>
        A silent pull, he doesn’t know how or why,<br>
        Yet every day he finds himself reaching the sky.<br><br>
        She speaks of distance, of keeping him far,<br>
        “Don’t chase me,” she whispers, “I’m not your star.”<br>
        But he can’t help it, he can’t step away,<br>
        For in her absence, his heart fades to gray.<br><br>
        He knows the storms, the cold, and the heat,<br>
        But he won’t let go, won’t accept defeat.<br>
        Like lightning’s flash, through darkness and night,<br>
        He’ll be her shadow, her source of light.<br><br>
        “I’ll stay with you,” he whispers, “no matter the cost,<br>
        Even if love’s path is twisted and lost.<br>
        I’ll be the flame that refuses to die,<br>
        I’ll fight for your heart, I’ll reach for the sky.”<br><br>
        He doesn’t need the world, no other dreams,<br>
        Just her, forever, or so it seems.<br>
        He’s not ready to lose her, not ready to let go,<br>
        Even if the winds of time cruelly blow.<br><br>
        So she warns him again, her voice soft but clear,<br>
        “Don’t fall for me, I’ll just disappear.”<br>
        But he smiles, determined, his eyes shining bright,<br>
        “For you, I’ll wait forever, I’ll fight.”<br>`

        They fly, beloved, only to you.<br>
        My heart is tangled in memory’s thread,<br>
        It must be weeping, by sweet sorrow led,<br>
        And tears will fall, a silent, painful flow,<br>
        But do not let the bond we share ever go.<br><br>
        It’s hard to speak now, where did my words stray?<br>
        Perhaps a friend has spoken out of the way.<br>
        But know this truth, my dear, please trust and see,<br>
        This isn’t like the past, just lean on me.<br><br>
        You take the first step, let your courage begin,<br>
        For in your breath, I promise to live within.<br>
        I will fill this wide world with the purest of love,<br>
        A gentle offering from the heavens above.<br><br>
        You simply dream, and I will make the dreams come true,<br>
        To have your heart, I’ll wait my last breath through.<br>
        Take my hand once — this is no joke I make,<br>
        Wherever you walk, for goodness gracious sake,<br>
        My shadow will follow, your constant, loyal guide,<br>
        Forever standing right there by your side.<br><br>
        Just smile for me now, one true, lovely flash,<br>
        And let your gentle hand meet mine in a dash.<br>
        In your gaze, my world finds its reason to be,<br>

        a quiet war, unnamed with pains.<br><br>
        The mirror bleeds a stranger’s face,<br>
        eyes like graves — no trace of grace.<br>
        Dreams collapse where hope once slept,<br>
        and all I’ve loved I’ve never kept.<br><br>
        I walk through hours that never end,<br>
        time’s a curse that won’t bend.<br>
        The air is heavy, thick with sin,<br>
        I’m rotting slow beneath my skin.<br><br>
        My thoughts are knives that hum in me,<br>
        they carve my peace, endlessly.<br>

        I misplaced the shape of being.<br>
        My soul — a room unlit for years,<br>
        still echoing someone’s leaving.<br><br>
        The sky writes eulogies in dawn,<br>
        each ray a wound I’ve memorized.<br>
        The wind repeats forgotten names,<br>
        the ones I buried, still disguised.<br><br>
        I walk through hours made of dust,<br>
        the clocks have stopped inside my chest.<br>

        when emptiness won’t rest.<br><br>
        The stars once whispered truths to me,<br>
        now they only stare, polite and cold.<br>
        I am the shadow of a thought,<br>
        that never wanted to grow old.<br><br>
        My heartbeat drips like melting wax,<br>
        time folding in its fragile art.<br>
        I am the echo after sound,<br>
        the ghost still haunting its own heart.<br><br>
        And when I sleep — the dark arrives,<br>
        like someone who still knows my name.<br>

        You carved my name into your world,<br>
        A single story that shattered the silence of months.<br>
        To see myself through your eyes is a heavy grace,<br>
        The tears that blur my vision are heavy with the wait.<br><br>
        It is a different kind of joy, thick and overwhelming,<br>
        Like a tidal wave of salt and light.<br>
        The tears that fall are not fragile,<br>
        They are weighted with the truth of a thousand unspoken vows.<br><br>
